                <h2><i><b>Eugenesis;</b></i> a physically simulated model of eugenics on a Galton Board</h2>
                <p>
                Sir Francis Galton was a 19th Century English polymath, first cousin
                of Charles Darwin; and like many of his social class, cannot be said
                to have been a scholar of any one particular subject: His eclectic
                work ranges from instructions for correctly boiling tea to empirical
                research in the effectiveness of prayer.
                </p>

                <p>
                Among his more enduring legacy is the Galton Board. A statistical toy,
                where balls fall unpredictably through a matrix of pegs to collect in
                columns. Curiously, this chaotic bouncing will arrange them in a normal
                distribution; the famous Bell curve.
                </p>

                <p>
                However, Sir Galton was also the one who coined the term <i>eugenics</i>: from Greek, for
                <i>“well growth”</i>: the belief that it is possible to metrically improve a human
                population through selective breeding, or holocaust.
                </p>

                <p>
                What happens if we apply eugenics to the Galton Board? As
                the process results in a normal distribution; commonly found in psychometry,
                the board could be apt as substitute for a human population. How will it change, if culled?
                </p>

            <div class="vertical-panel" lang="en" style="justify-content: start;">
                <p>
                The board was paired with a timelapse of me drawing over Galton’s
                portrait in MS Paint, on a virtual install of Win98, limited to 5%
                CPU; making the process <i>very</i> slow.
                </p>
                <p>
                Paint is my first memory with computers as a child. I was given an
                old computer to have in my room, whose hard drive was faulty but
                was able to boot (with patience).
                </p>

                <p>
                However, this meant no programs could be installed, and nothing
                could be saved; whatever I did would exist only in
                short term  memory. To play on it was an act of meditation.
                </p>

                <p>
                I wanted this parallel as a form of the question, <i>“Would it be better
                if I was never born?”</i> And have it answered with the love of a child. I
                loved my computer, no matter how crippled and useless, I made it
                part of me, and would have mourned it like a friend.
                </p>
