                    The space is a reconstruction of the room I lived in from ages
                    ten to twenty-two, remade from memory. The game is posited as an
                    escape room - and the door is unlocked. Outside is an empty and
                    endless traversable space, inside there are no puzzles to solve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can sleep on my bed or exercise on my rowing machine, start
                    my computer to look through my files. Connecting the right cable
                    (this is trivial), you can watch a few classical movies I used to like on
                    the television I bought with my life insurance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These are things I've kept with me: some I can measure, some I’ve lost.
                    But this room will always be mine. I have very few memories from my time
                    here; little happened. Mostly I wanted to leave.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pressing Escape will shut down the game,<br>
                    leaving you free to do something useful.

                    ten to twenty-two, made from memory. Half the game thus posits as an
